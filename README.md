# Getting-Started-with-Lit
My learning from the Lit Documentation


Lit is Simple Fast Web Components.


To install the lit your environment/project run "npm i lit" in your terminal

# First Module
1. First of all we import the lit from the lit library
2. Then we extend our function from the LitElement class
3. Under our class we define the static properties
4. Under it we create a constructor, and declare the value for the properties with the super keyword
5. Then we render it in the HTML snippet
6. Atlast we call our custom component in our HTML file.
